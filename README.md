# Oasis Spring/Summer 2017 Lookbook Test

Thank you for your application for the Junior Web Developer role at Oasis Fashion!

This is a two hour test to check your skills in HTML/CSS and JavaScript.

This repository contains designs and assets such as fonts and images.

Your challenge is to build this page using breakpoints to change the layout between mobile/tablet and desktop (you may choose your own breakpoints).

Within the two hour time slot you must either commit your changes to this repository, or zip your directory and email it to danbas@oasis-stores.co.uk.

Good luck!
